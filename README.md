# Makena-Kirimi

Hello there, 
I am an Applied Statistics graduate who's recently seen the light and gotten serious about her career in tech. 
My passion for Software and Data Analysis has pushed me to hone my skills in: Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI and Tableau.
I am looking to collaborate on all Data Science projects you might think of such as: building data pipelones, data cleaning/mining/analysis/visualization, SQL querying/building databases and report writing.

Now past the career in data, I am a mean chef, makeup/fashion enthusiast, and a mental health advocate so hit me up anytime
